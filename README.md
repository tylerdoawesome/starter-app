This is the basic "start app" that I use for all of my Code This! YouTube tutorials.

## Quick Setup

Download this repository to be used locally on your machine, extract, and run the following
command from the command line / terminal at the project root.

### `npm start`

This will run the app in development mode, launching a local dev server,
and will open your default browser (I recommend using Chrome). <br>

Now, every time you make changes to your code, specifically in the src/App.js
file, the browser will automagically reload and display with every save (cmd+s). <br>

## Complete Getting Started Guide

experience, follow along with my [Getting Started With CodeThis!](http://localhost:3000) video.
